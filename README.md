# Robust build-dependencies

This repo contains native dependencies for Robust and `.nuspec` files to create NuGet packages for them.

## CEF

CEF is not included in the repo since it is absolutely massive. Check the version in the nuspec file for which to download.
If you're building packages, don't forget to strip the Linux binaries.
